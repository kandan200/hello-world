# hello-world
my playground in this second proper journey down the tech lane. lets bring this medtech dream home
it was always apparent to me that having a tech skill was essential even as a physician in a field increasing resistant to the tech forray
my first **proper** dive into the tech space was a beginner level course on *futurelearn* 
it was actually interesting as it gave an outlet for my creative side, but problem was consistency with practices after the course üòû
i was neck deep in my nysc call. initially being commited to the **COVID-19 vaccine** reseacrh publication, then my personal cds project, time was a big deal
i passed out just over 2 weeks ago and commited to chanelling most of my time towards self development over regular jobs. so for now im working on 2 gigs
1. usmle step 1 and dha exams
2. tech journey with ingressive for good + zuri
at the end of this first 5 months period i hope to have acquired adequate knowledge and expertise to tackle one of the fundamental challenges to universal access to quality healthcare - financing
so help me God üôè
